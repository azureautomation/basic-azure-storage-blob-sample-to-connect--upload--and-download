Basic Azure Storage Blob Sample to connect, upload, and download
================================================================

            

This Azure Automation Runbook sets up a connection to an Azure subscription and Azure Storage Account using certificate based authentication. It then creates a local file, creates a blob container, and uploads that file into the container as a blob. Last
 it downlods the file and writes the file contents as output. This is a simple toy sample, but it provides the basic outline to build Azure Automation Runbooks.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
